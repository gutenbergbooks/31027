<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> a day about mid-year in 1855, the conventional
literary world was startled into indecorous behavior
by the unannounced appearance of a thin quarto
sheaf of poems, in form and in tone unlike anything of
precedent issue. It was called Leaves of Grass, and
there were but twelve poems in the volume. No author&#8217;s
name appeared upon the title page, the separate poems
bore no captions, there was no imprint of publisher. A
steel engraving of a man presumably between thirty and
forty years of age, coatless, shirt flaringly open at the
neck, and a copyright notice identifying Walter Whitman
with the publication, furnished the only clues. Uncouth
in size, atrociously printed, and shockingly frank
in the language employed, the volume evoked such a
tirade of rancorous condemnation as perhaps bears no
parallel in the history of letters. From contemporary
criticisms might be compiled an Anthology of Anathema
comparable to Wagner&#8217;s Schimpf-Lexicon, or the
Dictionary of Abuse suggested by William Archer for
Henrik Ibsen. Some of the striking adjectives and
phrases employed in print would include the following,
as applied either to the verses or their author:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>The slop-bucket of Walt Whitman.</li>
<li>A belief in the preciousness of filth.</li>
<li>Entirely bestial.</li>
<li>Nastiness and animal insensibility to shame.</li>
<li>Noxious weeds.</li>
<li>Impious and obscene.</li>
<li>Disgusting burlesque.</li>
<li>Broken out of Bedlam.</li>
<li>Libidinousness and swell of self-applause.</li>
<li>Defilement.</li>
<li>Crazy outbreak of conceit and vulgarity.</li>
<li>Ithyphallic audacity.</li>
<li>Gross indecency.</li>
<li>Sunken sensualist.</li>
<li>Rotten garbage of licentious thoughts.</li>
<li>Roots like a pig.</li>
<li>Rowdy Knight Errant.</li>
<li>A poet whose indecencies stink in the nostrils.</li>
<li>Its liberty is the wildest license; its love the essence of the lowest lust!</li>
<li>Priapus&mdash;worshipping obscenity.</li>
<li>Rant and rubbish.</li>
<li>Linguistic silliness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></li>
<li>Inhumanly insolent.</li>
<li>Apotheosis of Sweat.</li>
<li>Mouthings of a mountebank.</li>
<li>Venomously malignant.</li>
<li>Pretentious twaddle.</li>
<li>Degraded helot of literature.</li>
<li>His work, like a maniac&#8217;s robe, bedizened with fluttering tags of a thousand colors.</li>
<li>Roaming, like a drunken satyr, with inflamed blood, through every field of lascivious thought.</li>
<li>Muck of abomination.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few quotations from the press of this period will
serve to indicate the general tenor of comment:</p>

<p>&#8220;The book might pass for merely hectoring and ludicrous,
if it were not something a great deal more
offensive,&#8221; observed the Christian Examiner (Boston,
1856). &#8220;It openly deifies the bodily organs, senses, and
appetites in terms that admit of no double sense. The
author is &#8216;one of the roughs, a Kosmos, disorderly,
fleshly, sensual, divine inside and out. The scent of
these armpits an aroma finer than prayer.&#8217; He leaves
&#8216;washes and razors for foofoos,&#8217; thinks the talk about
virtue and vice only &#8216;blurt,&#8217; he being above and indifferent
to both of them. These quotations are made with
cautious delicacy. We pick our way as cleanly as we can
between other passages which are more detestable.&#8221;</p>

<p>In columns of bantering comment, after parodying
his style of all-inclusiveness, the United States Review
(1855) characterizes Walt Whitman thus: &#8220;No skulker
or tea-drinking poet is Walt Whitman. He will bring
poems to fill the days and nights&mdash;fit for men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
women with the attributes of throbbing blood and flesh.
The body, he teaches, is beautiful. Sex is also beautiful.
Are you to be put down, he seems to ask, to that
shallow level of literature and conversation that stops
a man&#8217;s recognizing the delicious pleasure of his sex, or
a woman hers? Nature he proclaims inherently clean.
Sex will not be put aside; it is the great ordination of
the universe. He works the muscle of the male and the
teeming fibre of the female throughout his writings, as
wholesome realities, impure only by deliberate intention
and effort. To men and women, he says, you can
have healthy and powerful breeds of children on no less
terms than these of mine. Follow me, and there shall
be taller and richer crops of humanity on the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Studies among the Leaves, printed in the
Crayon (New York, 1856), this extract may be taken:
&#8220;With a wonderful vigor of thought and intensity of
perception, a power, indeed, not often found, Leaves of
Grass has no identity, no concentration, no purpose&mdash;it
is barbarous, undisciplined, like the poetry of a half-civilized
people, and as a whole useless, save to those
miners of thought who prefer the metal in its unworked
state.&#8221;</p>

<p>The New York Daily Times (1856) asks: &#8220;What
Centaur have we here, half man, half beast, neighing
defiance to all the world? What conglomerate of
thought is this before us, with insolence, philosophy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
tenderness, blasphemy, beauty, and gross indecency
tumbling in drunken confusion through the pages? Who
is this arrogant young man who proclaims himself the
Poet of the time, and who roots like a pig among a rotten
garbage of licentious thoughts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Other poets,&#8221; notes a writer in the Brooklyn Daily
Eagle (1856), &#8220;other poets celebrate great events, personages,
romances, wars, loves, passions, the victories
and power of their country, or some real or imagined
incident&mdash;and polish their work, and come to conclusions,
and satisfy the reader. This poet celebrates
natural propensities in himself; and that is the way he
celebrates all. He comes to no conclusions, and does
not satisfy the reader. He certainly leaves him what
the serpent left the woman and the man, the taste of
the Paradise tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
never to be erased again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation
like a drunken Hercules amid the dainty dancers,&#8221;
suggested the Christian Spiritualist (1856). &#8220;The
book abounds in passages that cannot be quoted in
drawing rooms, and expressions that fall upon ears
polite with a terrible dissonance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor was savage criticism in the years 1855 and 1856
limited to this side of the Atlantic. The London Critic,
in a caustic review, found this the mildest comment
that Whitman&#8217;s verse warranted: &#8220;Walt Whitman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
gives us slang in the place of melody, and rowdyism
in the place of regularity. *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Walt Whitman
libels the highest type of humanity, and calls his
free speech the true utterance of a man; we who may
have been misdirected by civilization, call it the expression
of a beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noisy as was this babel of discordant voices, one
friendly greeting rang clear. Leaves of Grass had but
just come from the press, when Ralph Waldo Emerson,
from his home in Concord, under date of July 21, 1855,
wrote to the author in genuine fellowship:</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I
have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said
incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage
of treatment which so delights us, and which large
perception only can inspire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which
yet must have had a long foreground somewhere, for
such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this
sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the
book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits,
namely, of fortifying and encouraging.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tracing the popular estimates of Walt Whitman
through the next five years, expressions of unmeasured
disapproval similar to those quoted may be found in
periodicals and in the daily press, with here and there
grudging admission that despite unseemly tendencies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
there is evident originality and even genius in the pages
of this unusual book. In a comparatively temperate
review, August 4, 1860, the Cosmopolite, of Boston,
while deploring that nature is treated here without fig-leaves,
declares the style wonderfully idiomatic and
graphic, adding: &#8220;In his frenzy, in the fire of his inspiration,
are fused and poured out together elements
hitherto considered antagonistic in poetry&mdash;passion, arrogance,
animality, philosophy, brag, humility, rowdyism,
spirituality, laughter, tears, together with the most
ardent and tender love, the most comprehensive human
sympathy which ever radiated its divine glow through
the pages of poems.&#8221;</p>

<p>A contemporary of this date, the Boston Post, found
nothing to commend. &#8220;Grass,&#8221; said the writer, making
the title of the book his text, &#8220;grass is the gift of
God for the healthy sustenance of his creatures, and its
name ought not to be desecrated by being so improperly
bestowed upon these foul and rank leaves of the poison-plants
of egotism, irreverance, and of lust, run rampant
and holding high revel in its shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the London Lancet, July 7, 1860, comments in
this wise: &#8220;Of all the writers we have ever perused,
Walt Whitman is the most silly, the most blasphemous,
and the most disgusting. If we can think of any
stronger epithets, we will print them in a second
edition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8221;</p>



<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat</span> were these poems which excited such vitriolic
epithets? Taking both the editions of 1855
and of the year following, and indeed including all of
the four hundred poems bearing Whitman&#8217;s authorship
in the three-quarters of a half-century during which his
final volume was in the making, scarcely half a dozen
poems can be found which could give offense to the
most prudish persons. Nearly all of these have been
grouped, with some others, under the general sub-title
Children of Adam. There are poems which excite the
risibles of some readers, there are poems which read
like the lists of a mail-order house, and others which
appear in spots to have been copied bodily from a gazetteer.
These, however, are more likely to provoke good-natured
banter than violent denunciatory passion. Even
Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose generous greeting and
meed of praise in the birth-year of Leaves of Grass will
be recalled, in sending a copy of it to Carlyle in 1860,
and commending it to his interest, added: &#8220;And after
you have looked into it, if you think, as you may, that
it is only an auctioneer&#8217;s inventory of a warehouse, you
can light your pipe with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Whitman omitted the few poems whose titles are
given here, doubtless a few readers would have found
his formless verses either curious or ludicrous, or merely
stupid, and others would have passed them by as unmeriting
even casual attention. The poems which are
chiefly responsible for a controversy which raged for
half a century, are these:</p>

<ul><li>I sing the body electric.</li>
<li>A woman waits for me.</li>
<li>To a common prostitute.</li>
<li>The dalliance of the eagles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wholly dissociated from the picturesque personality
from which the book emanated, Leaves of Grass
bears a unique story margined on its pages. The sprawling
types whose muddy imprint on the ill-proportioned
pages made up the uncouth first edition of the book,
were put together by the author&#8217;s hands, and the sorry
press work was his handiwork as well. The unusual
preface and the twelve poems that followed he wrote
in the open, while lounging on the wharves, while crossing
on ferry-boats, while loitering in the fields, while sitting
on the tops of omnibuses. His physical materials
were the stubs of pencils, the backs of used envelopes,
scraps of paper that easily came to hand. The same
open-air workshops and like crude tools of writing he
utilized for nearly forty years. During the thirty-seven
years that intervened between the first printing of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Leaves and his death in 1892, he followed as his chief
purpose in life the task he had set himself at the beginning
of his serious authorship&mdash;the cumulative expression
of personality in the larger sense which is manifest
in the successive and expanding editions of his Leaves
of Grass. That book becomes therefore, a life history.
Incompletely as he may have performed this self-imposed
task, his own explanation of his purpose may well
be accepted as made in good faith. That explanation
appears in the preface to the 1876 edition, and amid the
multitude of paper scraps that came into the possession
of his executors, following his passing away, may be
found similar clues:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was originally my intention, after chanting in
Leaves of Grass the songs of the body and of existence,
to then compose a further, equally-needed volume, based
on those convictions of perpetuity and conservation
which, enveloping all precedents, make the unseen soul
govern absolutely at last. I meant, while in a sort continuing
the theme of my first chants, to shift the slides
and exhibit the problem and paradox of the same ardent
and fully appointed personality entering the sphere of
the resistless gravitation of spiritual law, and with cheerful
face estimating death, not at all as the cessation, but
as somehow what I feel it must be, the entrance upon
by far the greater part of existence, and something
that life is at least as much for, as it is for itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Too long for repetition here, but important in the
same connection for a full understanding of Walt Whitman&#8217;s
motives, is that Backward Glance O&#8217;er Travel&#8217;d
Roads, wherein he summed up his work in fourteen
pages of prose, and with frank egotism appended this
anecdote in a footnote on the first page thereof: &#8220;When
Champollion, on his death bed, handed to the printer the
revised proof of his Egyptian Grammar, he said gayly,
&#8216;Be careful of this&mdash;it is my <i>carte de visite</i> to posterity.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Undaunted when ridicule poured over him, evenly
tranquil when abuse assailed him, unemotional when
praise was lavished upon him, unfalteringly and undeviatingly
he pursued his way. The group headings
which were added in successive editions of his book, indicate
the milestones of his journey from the time when
the Song of Myself noted the beginning, till Whispers
of Heavenly Death presaged the ending. Familiarity
with the main incidents and experiences of his life give
to the several annexes, as he was fond of calling the
additions that he made to each succeeding issue of his
Leaves, the clues of chapter headings: Children of
Adam; Calamus; Birds of Passage; Sea-Drift; By the
Roadside; Drum-Taps; Autumn Rivulets; Whispers of
Heavenly Death; Songs of Parting.</p>

<p>A check list of his principal editions of Leaves of
Grass, with characteristics noted, would serve almost
as a chronology of Whitman&#8217;s life story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>1855&mdash;<span class="smcap">First Edition.</span> Twelve poems were included
in this edition. They are without distinctive titles,
though in later issues they appeared with varying titles,
those given in the definitive edition being the following:</p>

<ul><li>Song of myself.</li>
<li>Song for occupations.</li>
<li>To think of time.</li>
<li>The sleepers.</li>
<li>I sing the body electric.</li>
<li>Faces.</li>
<li>Song of the answerer.</li>
<li>Europe.</li>
<li>A Boston ballad.</li>
<li>There was a child went forth.</li>
<li>My lesson complete.</li>
<li>Great are the myths.</li>
</ul>

<p>1856&mdash;<span class="smcap">Second Edition.</span> In this edition, the second,
there are thirty-two poems. The poems are given titles,
but not the same ones that were finally included.</p>

<p>1860&mdash;<span class="smcap">Third Edition.</span> The number of poems is one
hundred and fifty-seven.</p>

<p>1867&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fourth Edition.</span> The poems have grown in
number to two hundred and thirty-six. The inclusion
here of the war cluster Drum-Taps, and a rearrangement
of other clusters, marks this edition as a notable
one. Drum-Taps had appeared as a separate volume
two years earlier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>1871&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fifth Edition.</span> A total of two hundred and
seventy-three poems are here classified under general
titles, including for the first time, Passage to India, and
After All Not to Create Only, groups which prior to this
date were issued separately.</p>

Grass have been published under the editorship of
well-known literary men&mdash;among them, William M.
Rossetti, Ernest Rhys, W.&nbsp;T. Stead, and Oscar L.
Triggs. There have been translations into German,
French, Italian, Russian, and several Asiatic languages.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had my choice when I commenc&#8217;d,&#8221; he notes in his
Backward Glance of 1880; &#8220;I bid neither for soft
eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of
existing schools and conventions.... Unstopp&#8217;d
and unwarp&#8217;d by any influence outside the soul within
me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it
unerringly on record&mdash;the value thereof to be decided

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith</span> the war-time period came the turning point
in the popular estimate of Walt Whitman. No
doubt, too, his experiences during this time of stress and
storm influenced the rest of his career as a man and as
a writer. His service as a volunteer nurse in camp and
in hospital gave him a sympathetic insight and a patriotic
outlook tempered with gentleness which are reflected
in his poetry of this period, published under the
title Drum-Taps. His well-known song of sorrow, O
Captain, My Captain, is a threnody poignant with
genuine feeling. It has, more than any others of his
verses, lyric rather than plangent quality. When Lilacs
Last in the Dooryard Bloomed, and The Sobbing of
the Bells are other poems belonging to this distinctive
group. It is notable that in his lament over the death
of Lincoln, Whitman gives rhyme as well as rhythm to
the verses.</p>

<p>This was a time of triumph for Whitman in a literary
sense. In Germany, the poet Ferdinand Freiligrath
contributed to the Allgemeine Zeitung, Augsburg, May
10, 1868, a long article in praise of his work. In
England, his poetry attracted the attention of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Rossettis, Tennyson, John Addington Symonds. Mrs.
Anne Gilchrist defended him from the aspersions cast
upon his references to womanhood. A sympathetic
and friendly tone began to displace the collection
of distasteful adjectives which had been his meed
heretofore.</p>

<p>Then, in the latter part of 1865, occurred an episode
which drew around Whitman a circle of friends keen to
resent, and active to condemn, an act of injustice from
one high in authority. Among the influential friends
who rushed to his defense were John Burroughs and
William Douglas O&#8217;Connor, and the events which drew
their fire were these:</p>

<p>Whitman, whose health was shattered by his untiring
devotion and ministrations to ill and wounded soldiers,
had been given a minor clerkship in the Department of
the Interior. James Harlan was Secretary of the Department.
He had been a Methodist clergyman and
president of a western college. When his attention was
called to Whitman&#8217;s authorship of Leaves of Grass, the
Secretary characterized the book as &#8220;full of indecent
passages,&#8221; the author was termed &#8220;a very bad man,&#8221;
and was abruptly dismissed from the position he had
held for six months.</p>

<p>Whitman meekly accepted the curt dismissal, but
William Douglas O&#8217;Connor in a white heat of indignation
issued a pamphlet which flayed the astonished Secretary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the Interior as a narrow-minded calumniator. The
pamphlet, now a very rare document, was headed:</p>

<p class="center">
THE GOOD GRAY POET<br />
<small>A VINDICATION</small><br />
</p>

<p>With Celtic fervor and eloquence, William Douglas
O&#8217;Connor made his plea an intercession in the cause of
free letters. He examined the entire range of literature,
ancient and modern, in quest of parallels that
would prove Whitman&#8217;s book by comparison to be a
masterpiece of literature, and would demonstrate Mr.
Secretary Harlan to be merely a literary headsman. Out
of many pages of allusion to the literary productions of
the great writers of all time and for all time, some characteristic
passages may be chosen:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Here is Dante. Open the tremendous pages of the
Inferno. What is this line at the end of the twenty-first
canto, which even John Carlyle flinches from translating,
but which Dante did not flinch from writing?
Out with Dante!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the book of Job: the vast Arabian landscape,
the picturesque pastoral details of Arabian life, the last
tragic immensity of Oriental sorrow, the whole over-arching
sky of Oriental piety, are here. But here also
the inevitable &#8216;indecency.&#8217; Out with Job!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Plutarch, prince of biographers, and Herodotus,
flower of historians. What have we now? Traits
of character not to be mentioned, incidents of conduct,
accounts of manners, minute details of customs, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
our modern historical dandies would never venture
upon recording. Out with Plutarch and Herodotus!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Shakespeare: &#8216;indecent passages&#8217; everywhere;
every drama, every poem thickly inlaid with them;
all that men do displayed, sexual acts treated lightly,
jested about, mentioned obscenely; the language never
bolted; slang, gross puns, lewd words, in profusion.
Out with Shakespeare!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the Canticle of Canticles: beautiful, voluptuous
poem of love literally, whatever be its mystic
significance; glowing with the color, odorous with the
spices, melodious with the voices of the East; sacred
and exquisite and pure with the burning chastity of passion,
which completes and exceeds the snowy chastity
of virgins. This to me, but what to the Secretary? Can
he endure that the female form should stand thus in a
poem, disrobed, unveiled, bathed in erotic splendor?
Look at these voluptuous details, this expression of desire,
this amorous tone and glow, this consecration and
perfume lavished upon the sensual. No! Out with
Solomon!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Isaiah. The grand thunder-roll of that
righteousness, like the lion-roar of Jehovah above the
guilty world, utters coarse words. Amidst the bolted
lightnings of that sublime denunciation, coarse thoughts,
indelicate figures, indecent allusions, flash upon the
sight, like gross imagery in a midnight landscape. Out
with Isaiah!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Montaigne. Open those great, those virtuous
pages of the unflinching reporter of man; the soul
all truth and daylight, all candor, probity, sincerity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
reality, eyesight. A few glances will suffice. Cant and
vice and sniffle have groaned over these pages before.
Out with Montaigne!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Swedenborg. Open this poem of prose, the
Conjugal Love, to me, a temple, though in ruins; the
sacred fane, clothed in mist, filled with moonlight, of a
great though broken mind. What spittle of critic epithets
stains all here? &#8216;Lewd,&#8217; &#8216;sensual,&#8217; &#8216;lecherous,&#8217; &#8216;coarse,&#8217;
&#8216;licentious,&#8217; etc. Of course these judgments are final.
There is no appeal from the tobacco-juice of an expectorating
and disdainful virtue. Out with Swedenborg!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Goethe: the horrified squealing of prudes is
not yet silent over pages of Wilhelm Meister: that high
and chaste book, the Elective Affinities, still pumps up
oaths from clergymen. Walpurgis has hardly ceased
its uproar over Faust. Out with Goethe!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Cervantes: open Don Quixote, paragon of
romances, highest result of Spain, best and sufficient
reason for her life among the nations, a laughing novel
which is a weeping poem. But talk such as this of
Sancho Panza and Tummas Cecial under the cork trees,
and these coarse stories and bawdy words, and this free
and gross comedy&mdash;is it to be endured? Out with
Cervantes!</p>

<p>&#8220;And here is Lord Bacon himself, in one of whose
pages you may read, done from the Latin by Spedding
into a magnificent golden thunder of English, the absolute
defense of the free spirit of the great authors,
coupled with stern rebuke to the spirit that would pick
and choose, as dastard and effeminate. Out with Lord
Bacon!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Not him only, not these only, not only the writers
are under the ban. Here is Phidias, gorgeous sculptor
in gold and ivory, giant dreamer of the Infinite in
marble; but he will not use the fig-leaf. Here is Rembrandt,
who paints the Holland landscape, the Jew, the
beggar, the burgher, in lights and glooms of Eternity;
and his pictures have been called &#8216;indecent,&#8217; Here is
Mozart, his music rich with the sumptuous color of all
sunsets; and it has been called &#8216;sensual.&#8217; Here is
Michael Angelo, who makes art tremble with a new
and strange afflatus, and gives Europe novel and sublime
forms that tower above the centuries, and accost
the Greek; and his works have been called &#8216;bestial.&#8217;
Out with them all!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In his summing up, stirred to wrath by the low tone
of contemporary comment, O&#8217;Connor proceeded to expound
the philosophy of literary ideals:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The level of the great books is the Infinite, the Absolute.
To contain all, by containing the premise, the
truth, the idea and feeling of all, to tally the universe
by profusion, variety, reality, mystery, enclosure, power,
terror, beauty, service; to be great to the utmost conceivability
of greatness&mdash;what higher level than this can
literature spring to? Up on the highest summit stand
such works, never to be surpassed, never to be supplanted.
Their indecency is not that of the vulgar;
their vulgarity is not that of the low. Their evil, if it
be evil, is not there for nothing&mdash;it serves; at the base
of it is Love. Every poet of the highest quality is, in
the masterly coinage of the author of Leaves of Grass,
a kosmos. His work, like himself, is a second world,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
full of contrarieties, strangely harmonized, and moral
indeed, but only as the world is moral. Shakespeare is
all good, Rabelais is all good, Montaigne is all good, not
because all the thoughts, the words, the manifestations
are so, but because at the core, and permeating all, is
an ethic intention&mdash;a love which, through mysterious,
indirect, subtle, seemingly absurd, often terrible and
repulsive, means, seeks to uplift, and never to degrade.
It is the spirit in which authorship is pursued, as Augustus
Schlegel has said, that makes it either an infamy or
a virtue; and the spirit of the great authors, no matter
what their letter, is one with that which pervades the
Creation. In mighty love, with implements of pain
and pleasure, of good and evil, Nature develops man;
genius also, in mighty love, with implements of pain and
pleasure, of good and evil, develops man; no matter
what the means, that is the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me not, then, of the indecent passages of the
great poets. The world, which is the poem of God, is
full of indecent passages! &#8216;Shall there be evil in a city
and the Lord hath not done it?&#8217; shouts Amos. &#8216;I form
the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil; I, the Lord, do all these things,&#8217; thunders Isaiah.
&#8216;This,&#8217; says Coleridge, &#8216;is the deep abyss of the mystery
of God.&#8217; Ay, and the profound of the mystery of genius
also! Evil is part of the economy of genius, as it is part
of the economy of Deity. Gentle reviewers endeavor
to find excuses for the freedoms of geniuses. &#8216;It is to
prove that they were above conventionalities.&#8217; &#8216;It is
referable to the age.&#8217; Oh, Ossa on Pelion, mount piled
on mount, of error and folly! What has genius, spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the absolute and the eternal, to do with the definitions
of position, or conventionalities, or the age?
Genius puts indecencies into its works, because God
puts them into His world. Whatever the special reason
in each case, this is the general reason in all cases. They
are here, because they are there. That is the eternal
why. No; Alphonso of Castile thought that, if he had
been consulted at the Creation, he could have given a
few hints to the Almighty. Not I. I play Alphonso
neither to genius nor to God.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this poem, for the giving of which to America
and the world, and for that alone, its author has
been dismissed with ignominy from a Government
office? It is a poem which Schiller might have hailed
as the noblest specimen of native literature, worthy of a
place beside Homer. It is, in the first place, a work
purely and entirely American, autochthonic, sprung
from our own soil; no savor of Europe nor the past, nor
of any other literature in it; a vast carol of our own land,
and of its Present and Future; the strong and haughty
psalm of the Republic. There is not one other book, I
care not whose, of which this can be said. I weigh my
words and have considered well. Every other book by
an American author implies, both in form and substance,
I cannot even say the European, but the British
mind. The shadow of Temple Bar and Arthur&#8217;s Seat
lies dark on all our letters. Intellectually we are still
a dependency of Great Britain, and one word&mdash;colonial&mdash;comprehends
and stamps our literature. In no literary
form, except our newspapers, has there been anything
distinctively American. I note our best books&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
works of Jefferson, the romances of Brockden
Brown, the speeches of Webster, Everett&#8217;s rhetoric, the
divinity of Channing, some of Cooper&#8217;s novels, the writings
of Theodore Parker, the poetry of Bryant, the
masterly law arguments of Lysander Spooner, the miscellanies
of Margaret Fuller, the histories of Hildreth,
Bancroft and Motley, Ticknor&#8217;s History of Spanish
Literature, Judd&#8217;s Margaret, the political treatises of
Calhoun, the rich, benignant poems of Longfellow, the
ballads of Whittier, the delicate songs of Philip Pendleton
Cooke, the weird poetry of Edgar Poe, the wizard
tales of Hawthorne, Irving&#8217;s Knickerbocker, Delia Bacon&#8217;s
splendid sibyllic book on Shakespeare, the political
economy of Carey, the prison letters and immortal
speech of John Brown, the lofty patrician eloquence of
Wendell Phillips, and those diamonds of the first water,
the great clear essays and greater poems of Emerson.
This literature has often commanding merits, and much
of it is very precious to me; but in respect to its national
character, all that can be said is that it is tinged, more
or less deeply, with America; and the foreign model,
the foreign standards, the foreign ideas, dominate over
it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;At most, our best books were but struggling beams;
behold in Leaves of Grass the immense and absolute
sunrise! It is all our own! The nation is in it! In
form a series of chants, in substance it is an epic of
America. It is distinctively and utterly American.
Without model, without imitation, without reminiscence,
it is evolved entirely from our own polity and
popular life. Look at what it celebrates and contains!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hardly to be enumerated without sometimes using the
powerful, wondrous phrases of its author, so indissoluble
are they with the things described. The essences, the
events, the objects of America; the myriad, varied landscapes;
the teeming and giant cities; the generous and
turbulent populations; the prairie solitudes, the vast
pastoral plateaus; the Mississippi; the land dense with
villages and farms; the habits, manners, customs; the
enormous diversity of temperatures; the immense geography;
the red aborigines passing away, &#8216;charging the
water and the land with names&#8217;; the early settlements;
the sudden uprising and defiance of the Revolution; the
august figure of Washington; the formation and sacredness
of the Constitution; the pouring in of the emigrants;
the million-masted harbors; the general opulence
and comfort; the fisheries, and whaling, and gold-digging,
and manufactures, and agriculture; the
dazzling movement of new States, rushing to be great;
Nevada rising, Dakota rising, Colorado rising; the
tumultuous civilization around and beyond the Rocky
Mountains, thundering and spreading; the Union impregnable;
feudalism in all its forms forever tracked and
assaulted; liberty deathless on these shores; the noble
and free character of the people; the equality of male
and female; the ardor, the fierceness, the friendship, the
dignity, the enterprise, the affection, the courage, the
love of music, the passion for personal freedom; the
mercy and justice and compassion of the people; the
popular faults and vices and crimes; the deference of
the President to the private citizen; the image of Christ
forever deepening in the public mind as the brother of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
despised and rejected persons; the promise and wild
song of the future; the vision of the Federal Mother,
seated with more than antique majesty in the midst of
her many children; the pouring glories of the hereafter;
the vistas of splendor, incessant and branching, the tremendous
elements, breeds, adjustments of America&mdash;with
all these, with more, with everything transcendent,
amazing and new, undimmed by the pale cast of
thought, and with the very color and brawn of actual
life, the whole gigantic epic of our continental being unwinds
in all its magnificent reality in these pages. To
understand Greece, study the Iliad and the Odyssey;
study Leaves of Grass to understand America. Her
democracy is there. Would you have a text-book of
democracy? The writings of Jefferson are good; De
Tocqueville is better; but the great poet always contains
historian and philosopher&mdash;and to know the comprehending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
spirit of this country, you shall question
these insulted pages.&#8221;</p></div>



<h3><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> would be wearisome to refer in detail to the numerous
estimates of Leaves of Grass which have found
print since 1870. The increasing literature about Whitman
bespeaks interest, and the kindly tenor of most
commentators testifies to the enlarging appreciation of
the Good Gray Poet. Within the past decade there
have appeared seven biographies of him, all but one of
them wholly and frankly lavish in his praise, and that
one not unfriendly in criticism. Numerous book chapters
have dealt with him in recognition of his genius, and
only here and there have there been suggestions of
earlier absolute condemnation. Among the biographers
have been, in chronological sequence, Richard Maurice
Bucke, John Burroughs, John Addington Symonds,
Isaac Hull Platt, Geo. R. Carpenter, Bliss Perry, Henry
Bryan Binns. Among the notable contributors of book
chapters on Whitman may be mentioned from a list of
two score or more, Robert Louis Stevenson, in his
Studies of Men and Books; A.&nbsp;T. Quiller-Couch, in his
Adventures in Criticism; Thomas Wentworth Higginson,
in his Contemporaries; Havelock Ellis, in The New
Spirit; Edward Dowden, in his Studies in Literature;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Edmund Gosse, in his Critical Kit-Kats; Hamilton Mabie,
in his Backgrounds of Literature; Brander Matthews,
in his Aspects of Fiction; Edmund Clarence
Stedman, in his Poets of America; George Santayana,
in The Poetry of Barbarism; and Algernon Charles
Swinburne, in his Studies in Prose and Poetry. These
have been mentioned specifically because they average
the good and the bad rather than join in a chorus of
indiscriminate praise. Indeed, the two last mentioned
are distinctly hostile in tone. Swinburne, who in his
earlier volume Songs before Sunrise, addressed a long
poem, To Walt Whitman in America, fervent in praise,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Send but a song oversea for us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart of their hearts who are free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart of their singer to be for us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than our singing can be,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="newchapter">revoked all his former words of sympathetic admiration
and in his later volume, printed in 1894, vehemently fell
upon Whitman in this strain:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;There is no subject which may not be treated with
success (I do not say there are no subjects which on
other than artistic grounds it may not be as well to
avoid, it may not be better to pass by) if the poet, by
instinct or by training, knows exactly how to handle it
aright, to present it without danger of just or rational
offense. For evidence of this truth we need look no
further than the pastorals of Virgil and Theocritus. But
under the dirty clumsy paws of a harper whose plectrum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is a muck-rake any tune will become a chaos of discords,
though the motive of the tune should be the first principle
of nature&mdash;the passion of man for woman or the
passion of woman for man. And the unhealthily demonstrative
and obtrusive animalism of the Whitmaniad
is as unnatural, as incompatible with the wholesome
instincts of human passion, as even the filthy and inhuman
asceticism of SS. Macarius and Simeon Stylites.
If anything can justify the serious and deliberate display
of merely physical emotion in literature or in art,
it must be one of two things; intense depth of feeling
expressed with inspired perfection of simplicity, with
divine sublimity of fascination, as by Sappho; or transcendent
supremacy of actual and irresistible beauty in
such revelation of naked nature as was possible to
Titian. But Mr. Whitman&#8217;s Eve is a drunken apple-woman,
indecently sprawling in the slush and garbage
of the gutter amid the rotten refuse of her overturned
fruit-stall: but Mr. Whitman&#8217;s Venus is a Hottentot
wench under the influence of cantharides and adulterated
rum.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Weighing the good and the bad, Robert Louis Stevenson
in his essay does not stint admiration nor withhold
blame:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;He has chosen a rough, unrhymed, lyrical verse;
sometimes instinct with a fine processional movement;
often so rugged and careless that it can only be described
by saying that he has not taken the trouble to
write prose *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* and one thing is certain, that
no one can appreciate Whitman&#8217;s excellences until he
has grown accustomed to his faults.&#8221;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Indicating the attitude of his partisans, John Burroughs&#8217;
summing up is fairly representative:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Just as ripe, mellowed, storied, ivy-towered, velvet-turfed
England lies back of Tennyson, and is vocal
through him; just as canny, covenanting, conscience-burdened,
craggy, sharp-tongued Scotland lies back of
Carlyle; just as thrifty, well-schooled, well-housed, prudent
and moral New England lies back of her group of
poets, and is voiced by them&mdash;so America as a whole,
our turbulent democracy, our self-glorification, our faith
in the future, our huge mass-movements, our continental
spirit, our sprawling, sublime and unkempt nature
lie back of Whitman, and are implied by his work.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It is not the purpose of this book to interpret Whitman
either as a prophet or a poet, except inferentially
as the words of his critics may carry distinct impressions.
After all, the justest estimate of Whitman and
his book is his own. Whitman&#8217;s puzzling characteristics
are best understood if we realize that Leaves of
Grass is an autobiography&mdash;and an extraordinarily candid
one&mdash;of a man whose peculiar temperament found
expression in prose-verse. His gentleness, his brusqueness,
his egotism, his humility, his grossness, his finer
nature, his crudeness, his eloquence, are all here. To
him they were the attributes of all mankind.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuff&#8217;d with the stuff that is coarse, and stuff&#8217;d with the stuff that is fine.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his virile young manhood he announced with gusto:
&#8220;I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his serene old age he said: &#8220;Over the tree-tops I
float thee a song.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this was his conclusion: &#8220;I call to the world to
distrust the accounts of my friends, but listen to my
enemies as I myself do. I charge you forever reject those
who would expound me, for I cannot expound myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoso challenges Whitman&#8217;s gift of song may not
at any rate deny to him the note of melody. This quality
is strong in his titles particularly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rise O days from your fathomless deeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cabin&#8217;d ships at sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the cradle endlessly rocking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sands at seventy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sobbing of the bells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon shall the winter&#8217;s foil be here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mother with thy equal brood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the leaven&#8217;d soil they trod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon tides with ceaseless swell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sparkles from the wheel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother of all with generous hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a strong bird on pinions free.<br /></span>

<p>For a just estimate of Whitman, as for a clear comprehension
of the symbolism contained in Leaves of
Grass, a few blades of the latter will not suffice. It
must be all, or none. The two poems here given should
be taken, therefore, not as representative of the whole,
but as types of two widely variant moods:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="firstword"><span class="poemdropcap">O</span>&nbsp;f</span> olden time, when it came to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;That the beautiful god, Jesus, should finish his work on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then went Judas, and sold the divine youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took pay for his body.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Curst was the deed, even before the sweat of the clutching hand grew dry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkness frown&#8217;d upon the seller of the like of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from her, and heaven refus&#8217;d him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hung in the air, self-slaughter&#8217;d.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cycles, with their long shadows, have stalked silently forward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since those days&mdash;many a pouch enwrapping meanwhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fee, like that paid for the son of Mary.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And still goes one, saying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;What will ye give me, and I will deliver this man unto you?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they make the covenant, and pay the pieces of silver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Look forth, deliverer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look forth, first-born of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the tree-tops of Paradise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See thyself in yet-continued bonds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toilsome and poor, thou bear&#8217;st man&#8217;s form again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art reviled, scourged, put into prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunted from the arrogant equality of the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With staves and swords throng the willing servants of authority,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again they surround thee, mad with devilish spite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward thee stretch the hands of a multitude, like vultures&#8217; talons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nearest spit in thy face, they smite thee with their palms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bruised, bloody, and pinion&#8217;d is thy body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sorrowful than death is thy soul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Witness of anguish, brother of slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not with thy price closed the price of thine image:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still Iscariot plies his trade.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="i0">In this broad earth of ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enclosed and safe within its central heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nestles the seed perfection.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By every life a share or more or less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None born but it is born, conceal&#8217;d or unconceal&#8217;d the seed is waiting.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do you not see O my brothers and sisters?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not chaos or death&mdash;it is form, union, plan&mdash;it is eternal life&mdash;it is Happiness.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h5>V</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him&mdash;it cannot fail.<br /></span>

<h5>VI</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved, saying to the people <i>Do not weep for me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This is not my true country, I have lived banish&#8217;d from my true country, I now go back there,</i><br /></span>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>onnets</span> and apostrophes in large number addressed
to Walt Whitman during the later years of
his life, and since his passing away, have appeared in
fugitive form in widely separated sources. A selection
of these may prove of interest by reason of the names
attached, as well as because of the subject:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="firstword"><span class="poemdropcap">T</span>he</span> good gray poet&#8221; gone! Brave hopeful Walt!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might not be a singer without fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his large rough-hewn rhythm did not chime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dulcet daintiness of time and rhyme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was no neater than wide Nature&#8217;s wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More metrical than sea winds. Culture&#8217;s child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lapped in luxurious laws of line and lilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank from him shuddering, who was roughly built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cyclopean temples. Yet there rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True music through his rhapsodies, as he sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brotherhood, and freedom, love and hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strong, wide sympathy which dared to cope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all life&#8217;s phases, and call nought unclean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst hearts are generous, and whilst woods are green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall find hearers, who in a slack time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of puny bards and pessimistic rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared to bid men adventure and rejoice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His &#8220;yawp barbaric&#8221; was a human voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The singer was a man. America<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is poorer by a stalwart soul today,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may feel pride that she hath given birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this stout laureate of old Mother Earth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="firstword"><span class="poemdropcap">I</span> knew</span> there was an old, white-bearded seer<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></span>
<span class="i0">Who dwelt among the streets of Camden town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had the volumes which his hand wrote down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living evidence we love to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one who walks reproachless, without fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I saw that face, capped with its crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of snow-white almond-buds, his high renown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faded to naught, and only did appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The calm old man, to whom his verses tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sounds were music, even as a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the sudden knowledge on me fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the hours his fancies had beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No verse had shown the Poet half so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when he looked into my face and smiled.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We knew the rising splendor of thy sun could never wane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, the earth encompass&#8217;d, it sank in dazzling flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In faith assured we waited as in patience thou didst wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing full well the answer must sooner come or late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come it has, sufficingly, the discord disappears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until today again is heard the music of the spheres<br /></span>
